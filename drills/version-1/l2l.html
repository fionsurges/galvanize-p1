            <h2>3/4/18 - Gathering with Friends to Study on a Sunday</h2>
            <h3>Set the Stage</h3>
            <p>
                My goal for the day was to finish my CSS drill 2. I had already completed most of the drill prior to the weekend and had some final touches with flexbox and formatting that I wanted to finish before heading into very much anticipated and pre-planned dinner at Olive Garden.  
                <br><br>    
                My two friends and I made a plan to go study yesterday (Sunday) after eating lunch. We set the stage by making sure we were well fed, going to a coffee shop, and setting up shop. However, things took a turn for the worse when we could not find a table with any outlets in the sun. We decided to power through and set up our laptops, buy our coffees, and start working. Unfortunately, the music was too loud, the sun was too hot and within twenty minutes, our laptops were dying. We then decided to go chug our drinks and go to my house instead. 
                <br><br>
                Upon arriving at my house, we set up shop again, amped up from our chugged lattes, and got to work. We all agreed on a station for Alexa to play, cleared my table of plants and bills, then looked at the time (since we had dinner in a few hours), and decided to study until 3:30 before watching some tv prior to our dinner.

                When opened up my VSCode and refreshed the web browser for my HTML page, I noticed that it did not match changes I had previously made. I quickly panicked and went to search for the file, which was located in the right folder. However, every reload was loading the wrong page. After clicking around, I found that I had duplicated the folder and put it in another folder, making two versions, one with the right code and another with the older version.
                <br><br>
                After finding the right folder and deleting the old one, I was able to get started on my CSS drill 2. The actual work with formatting did not take long because I had hit a good stopping point on Friday and knew what I needed to finish up prior to submitting it (formatting margins and making sure I touched on all points in the rubric).
                <br><br>
                Because I had some time to spare, I started on drill 3 and created the layout in HTML. I drew the outline and sudo code for the drill and created the HTML file, but ran out of time before I was able to get started on the CSS peice.
            </p>

                The first half of this study session felt like a disaster. My friends and I were pretty distraught after thinking we had the perfect plan for our Sunday study session. We also had a time crunch, which set in some unease as we were changing locations. 
                <br><br>
                Once we got settled at my house, I believe our stage setting was successful. I was able to complete drill 2, submit it and get started on drill 3.
                <br><br>
                Because I had felt the anxiety of running out of time, I was able to power through my second CSS drill without the distractions of notifications. It also helped that my friends were there already and I did not feel the need to respond to my messages immediately. Having others focused on work in my presence really helps me get settled and focus as well.
                <br><br>
                I also learned that keeping my filed organized is very important. I thought they were organized before, but this duplicate folder made me reconsider how I should organize my files. Instead of nesting them folder upon folder, I moved my Projects folder into the Home directory and all others in a separate "Galvanize" folder. The Projects folder should be the source of truth and if there are random stragglers, it will be investigated.
                <br><br>
                At dinner, we discussed studying agian next Sunday, but at someone's house rather than a coffee shop. I think we are a bit traumatized by this experience.

            <h2>3/5/18 - Completing first L2L drill and CSS Grid</h2>
            <h3>Set the Stage</h3>
            <p>
                I started off setting the stage with my intentions for the day. I had two goals set: complete the first L2L drill and complete the last CSS drill. 
                <br><br>
                I had been dreading the drill because I wasn't sure of what content I needed to include or exclude. Luckily, there was a breakout for the requirements and helped set the stage for the assignment. I took notes at the breakout and immediately wrote the blog afterwards. My goal was to finish it before lunch and with the notes fresh in my head, I plugged in my music and typed away.
                <br><br>
                After lunch, my second goal was to finish the CSS drill 3. I did not have a set plan as to how I was going to compelete the drill, but figured I would start with the Grid Garden.
                <br><br>
                I also downloaded a promodoro timer on my computer and changed the settings from 25 minutes to 15 minute increments because I could not get myself focused after lunch. I put my phone on do not disturb and turned off all notifications for messages on my computer. I left my slack notifications on because I tend to do a good job filtering those out based on priority. 
            </p>
            <h3>Play</h3>
            <p>
                The L2L drill went smoothly overall. I tend to have an issue with getting started on writing, but when I start, I end up typing on and on. I knew exactly what I wanted to write about and typed away. I also set the goals and outlines for the second drill today. 
                <br><br>
                The second part of my day was when things started to take a turn for the worst. I had my leftover Olive Garden for lunch and quickly fell into a food coma from the carb overload. I tend to walk a fine line between not eating enough and overeating, thus leading me to be a lump for the next hour or so. I tried to drink some water to try to renergize me, but it did not help and I ended up sitting there feeling too full. I finally caved and went for a cup of coffee - which worked.
                <br><br>
                The promodoro timer on my computer was really helpful. I set the time increments to 15 minutes at a time, which allowed me to test out what time periods work and do not work. After the first 15 minutes, I had a great fear that my computer would beep every 15 minutes and spent a little too much time trying to figure out how to pair my earbuds to my computer before giving up.
                <br><br>
                After playing with the grid garden for a moment, I looked back at the CSS drill and decided I did not need to finish all the levels to finish the drill. I was also hitting a level of desperation to finish the drill and move forward because CSS had been the bain of my existence for the last week. 
                <br><br>
                At around 3:30, I ran over to Peter and we knocked out the drill.

                The first half of the day felt very productive, but the second half was an immense struggle. I feel that a lot of the struggle was due to the lack of setting the stage properly, but also taught me how to I should set the stage for today.
                <br><br>
                First, I need to learn how to pair my earbuds to my computer (which I did not do) or sacrifice it for the day and use my phone.
                <br><br>
                Turning my phone on do not disturb while taking off notifications on messages made me unrealistically productive. I think it also had something to do with the timer and seeing it on screen made me tell myself to wait it out till the end of it. It was almost like a competition against who would win - the timer or me. I also learned that my timer did not beep while my sound was off and my anxiety has decreased.
                <br><br>    
                Lastly, I realized that I do not need to complete all the practice in order to complete drills. The grid garden helped me understand grid, but I did not use it for the last drill. At some point, I called it quits and went head first into the drill because it was now or never (and I didn't want to have to look at it again for at least a day). I also wanted to complete it to the best of my ability, turn it in, and get my feedback for some direction on what I should have been doing or not doing. 
                <br><br>
                I'm not sure why I didn't think about asking someone for help earlier. I believe I was too focused on setting my stage, my timer, etc, and had I not taken a huge glance around the 4th floor, I wouldn't have run over to Peter for help. Two people working on the drill together was way more efficient than myself.

            <p class="p-list">
                Earlier this week, I had set out a goal to complete the JS drills for gMoney by the end of the week. With my family in town and my doctor's appointment on Tuesday afternoon/Wednesday morning, I started feeling like I was falling behind on my personal goal and could not get in a good headspace. Last night, I went home, made myself dinner, and did not think about anything Galvanize because the last day had been a nonstop whirlwind of events and I figured I would be very unsettled if I kept on working.
                <br><br>
                To set the stage for today's Javascript work, I brought my "Javascript for Kids" book with the intention of referring to it and learning more on JS syntax and formatting. I understand the logic of what the gMoney drills were looking for, but really struggled with writing the code since I had not studied JS as much as I wanted prior to the course.
                <br><br>
                This morning, I reached out to Peter to see whether we could coordinate a group and work on the drills together. There was also a breakout posted for 2:00pm that I intended to attend for additional help. I actually planned on putting my music away today because I wanted to work with my peers and talk through drills rather than sit there in my own headspace.
                <br><br>
                My goals were to finish the first drill by lunch, then start on the kickbacks for my CSS drills and compelete this third L2L by the end of the day (and drink 72 ounces of water but I have accepted that this is a "loose" goal now).
            </p>

            <p>
                The "up down" warmup today for the class really got my brain turning with Javascript. I finished the drill early and while I was waiting, took another stab at gMoney drill 1. I had a question about indexing through the transaction object and asked Conor if I had set it up correctly, which quickly led into a "let's take a look at this and see how we can work through the function." I did end up working with Peter and Co. on the drill1 and found that it was not as hard as I had made it out to be. While I was working through the functions, I explained the logic to Nick and Onder with Marlena's scoping table, which quickly turned into my own whiteboard session.
                <br><br>
                We all decided to reconvene after lunch to work on gMoney and took a quick lunch. After lunch, I was able to finish up the second and third drill. Once I figured out how to index through the transaction objects, I found that the other functions were very easy to build. I had touched on a few similar functions during the JavaScript fundamentals.
                <br><br>
                Conor was working on resubmitting his gMoney drills and was there to validate the questions and provide a second eye to to my code when I was stuck. Most of my errors were syntax and he was able to help point them out. 
                <br><br>
                I ended up switching my priorities for the L2L drill and CSS kick backs because I felt that I was very productive in that short span of time. Instead of racking my brain right now on CSS, I felt that my time would be better spent writing this blog. That way I will still be on target with my goals for today and not lose focus. I also did not need to attend the breakout and bought myself an extra hour. 
                <br><br>
                Prior to writing this blog post, I went to the bathroom, put in my music, and turned all my notifications on "do not disturb." I only had 20% left of battery on my computer and set a goal to finish the post before the laptop died.

                I feel that today has been a very productive day. 
                <br><br>
                I woke up particularly tired and went to a workout class, which made me more tired and actually put me in a bad mood. However, knowing that I came to Galvanize prepared with my book this morning seemed to have set a lot of positive notions in motion. I think that having this game plan yesterday from losing so much time to family and doctor helped a lot while I was preparing for my day.
                <br><br>
                I was slightly dreading the JS drill this morning because it just seemed to be a huge jumble of letters in my head. However, getting started and working through the logic in my head helped solve the function without help from others. I was even able to help someone else debug their code. 
                <br><br>
                Sometimes I am not a big fan of working in groups or power by numbers, but today really proved it otherwise. I'd say that working in the big group wasn't as helpful as I had anticipated, but having Conor there to bounce questions off of and provide a second eye on my code changed the course of my day. Some things as simple as using a comma instead of a semicolon, or flipping two letters in my variables, made all the difference in the world. After staring at the code forever, it's easy to miss these things and having someone there to gander over it made me more productive than it would have on my own. 
                <br><br>
                Finishing the drills today was kind of surprising to me. I thought I would be in the midst of the second drill before I decided I would need a break and change focus. Finishing all three of them actually took less time than I had anticpated and now I am on track to finish this last L2L drill and start on my CSS kick backs before our lightning talks today. 
                <br><br>
                Throughout the course of writing these L2L drills, I feel that I've learned a lot on how I can stay productive during the day. I am not one that needs to listen to music in order to get in my headspace while studying, but it is absolutely necessary when I want to sit down and write something. I also learned that I am weirdly obsessive about having my water bottle filled at all times even though I never drink as much as I set out to... Lastly, I found that putting my notifications on do not disturb has increased my productivity by tenfold. I would have never thought a small change would make such a large impact given that I'm a master multi-tasker with my phone these days. These L2L drills have taught me a great deal about myself and how to iterate on mistakes for improvement moving forward.
