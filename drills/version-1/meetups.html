            <h2>LGBT in Tech @ Union Station 02/21</h2>

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>
                There is a lot of diversity in tech amongst different groups of minorities. The LGBT community in particular faces a lot of diversity because more people are outwardly trans or entering this field and breaking stereotypes. As they do so, it's inevitable that colleagues or coworkers will do a double take or take a moment to "identify" them since it is not a "norm" in the industry yet. Everyone is intelligent and capable regardless of culture, ethnicity, gender, and affiliation.

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>
                Vue is a really nice and clean framework for Javascript built from Angular. There are a lot of great features and it is completely open source and not funded or acquired by a large corporation, making it a very desirable platform for developers to work on. However, the lack of funding has also caused a slower adoption of the platform by large companies because it makes them weary. There is a very large following and there is a big push from the commnuity to start opening companies to the platform migrating towards using it.

            <h2>Building Strava Product Experiences 3/1</h2>
            <h4>People I Met</h4>
            <p>
                Steve Lloyd - Sr. Director of Product Engineering at Strava

            <h4>What I Learned</h4>
            <p>
                Strava's product is more than a gps tracker for your bike rides. Their goal is to be the social network of athletes. They initially started with a product and release cycle that would take a quarter conduct an a/b test and send updates to their users. After redeisnging their product and coming up with a few operational strategies, they are now releasing an update once every week, acquiring more users and less churn. 
                <br><br>
                This was by far the best meetup I attended for networking purposes. I also learned that in order for a product to stay relevant and be successful, it must constantly appeal to users and maintain the userbase. Coming from the operational side of a small tech company, this made me reflect on how our product cycles ran and what the company could have improved on.

            <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
            <p>
                How will a company like Strava maintain it's standing in the marketplace as other fitness apps like FitBit are constantly growing and staying a step ahead? What will set them apart?
