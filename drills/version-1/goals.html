            <p>Drink 3 bottles of water by 4 pm today</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I did not drink 3 bottles of water today</li>
                    <li>Instead of making the goal a quantity of water to drink, I will set reminders to drink water instead</li>
                </ul>  
            <p>Commit and push 2+ files into GitHub with no errors/failures</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Making the goal to commit and push 2 files to Github was a win for me today because it ensured that I am able to use Github through the command line without spending too much time problem solving errors</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Study HTML and CSS for two hours</p>
                <ul>         
                    <li>Setting a minimum time limit for studying HTML and CSS allowed me to study and work on the drills for longer than my original intended time</li>
                    <li>This worked very well and I may start allocating times towards goals starting tomorrow</li>
                </ul>   
            <p>Complete and submit one drill</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I did not complete all my drills today because they are all started but not finished out</li>
                    <li>Tomorrow, I will make a to do list and make sure to finish out short term goals/projects that do not take longer than 10 minutes each before moving onto the next one</li>

                    <li>Attended one breakout session on JS and one on Flexbox today</li>
                    <li>Went well because I had already planned them to do so and was looking forward to the breakouts</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Tomorrow, I can try to set an amount within a specific time frame</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Goal was met</li>
                    <li>I think setting a minumum commitment was has been helpful because it makes it easier to exceed the time</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This kind of went hand in hand with not exceeding 40 minutes of studying at a time</li>
                    <li>Because I did not do so, I also did not do much reflecting</li>
