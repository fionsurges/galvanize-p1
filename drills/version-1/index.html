        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Fion. I am a technology professional currently enrolled in Galvanize's Web Development Immersive. My two passions in life include technology and politics. Before my career in technology, I worked local and statewide political campaigns. The political career was a short stint, as I quickly decided that it would remain a passion/hobby, while my career ought to be in technology instead. 
          <br><br>
          My first job in tech was as a Sales Development rep at a mid-size company, who later got acquired. After the acquisition, I joined a smaller tech company that builds chat bots, as their Operations Manager/Product Manager. I wore many hats at this company with my sales background and technology knowledge. While I was in the product management sphere, I quickly realized that I wanted to learn programming in order to be a contributer and make a difference to companies. 
          <br><br>
          Which leads me to Galvanize. I am now enrolled in Galvanize's Web Development Immersive g84 cohort, learning and training to a developer. My continue to be passionate about bot technology, as well as advertisement tech.
          <br><br>
          My hobbies aside from technology include: advanced napping, pretending I'm still pursuing a career as a pianist, yoga, and being too involved in my friend group.
